        <p className="text-m font-light leading-relaxed text-gray-400 mb-4">
          My journey began in a small town where I discovered my passion for
          technology and creativity at an early age. From assembling computers
          to designing basic websites, my curiosity for innovation drove me to
          explore the world of programming.
        </p>
        <p className="text-m font-light leading-relaxed text-gray-400 mb-4">
          I pursued a degree in Computer Science, where I honed my skills in
          frontend development, focusing on crafting user-centric web
          applications. During this time, I worked on multiple projects that
          allowed me to merge design and functionality seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p className="text-m font-light leading-relaxed text-gray-400 mb-4">
          Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked with technologies like React, Next.js, and
          Node.js, building everything from static websites to dynamic, scalable
          applications. Beyond coding, I am deeply inspired by art and
          storytelling, which influence my designs and help me connect with
          audiences on a deeper level.
        </p>
        <p className="text-m font-light leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          Today, as a frontend developer, I strive to create digital experiences
          that are not only visually appealing but also functional and
          accessible to all.
